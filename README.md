# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# Hi There!

My name is Justin Morrison and I am a 3rd year Software Engineering Student at Carleton.

I made this project in response to the defunding of the Peer Assisted Study Session (PASS) program at Carleton that I personally used and know other students found quite helpful.

This project right now is only focused on supporting ***SYSC2006: Introduction to Imperative Programming*** (The course code may have changed)

It mostly follow the same order of operations as course when I took it, but some lessons I felt were out of place or explained poorly so I will make my best effort to remedy those issues.

My plan right now is to provide:
- My notes on each of the lessons
- Exercises on each of the concepts which will take form as:
    - End of "lecture" quizzes in the notes
    - Fill in the blank questions
    - Pop quiz style questions in the notes
    - Longer coding questions where I run tests to validate your code ?
- Live takeup sessions/talk throughs?
