Intro to C
</title>

C is what is called a **procedural programming language**. 

<definition title="Procedural Progamming Language">
A programming language where code is grouped into functions/procedures. The programs state is managed by variables and changed using assignment statements. Statements are executed sequentially and often use conditional statements to decide what code to execute and loops to execute some code numerous times.
</definition>

## Why teach C?

C is one of oldest (built in 1970) programming languages which is the basis of so much of the software world. If/when you learn Java or C++, you will see the similarities to C.



Many "modern" languages (Python, Java, Go, Javascript) do what is called **garbage collection** which make them easier to use and less *potentially* dangerous. 


<definition title="Garbage Collection">
A term used to describe a feature of a programming language that automatically manages its memory. It is often a program on top of the programs you write and take care of memory management in the background. 
</definition>


C does not have a garbage collector, so you need to understand how to manage a computer's memory manually. The main topics you will learn in this course that are integral to memory management are:
- Pointers
- malloc
- free



Most students find that these topics are the toughest concepts in the course. However, by the end of the course you should be comfortable enough with this concept to write programs which today you might feel overwhelmed to even try.

## Benefits of C

#### Well...that seems like a lot of cons to using C. What are the benefits?


1. C is a very simple language. What I mean by that is that there are very few **keywords** you need to remember.
2. If you learn C well, learning other languages afterwards becomes much easier due to how fundemental C is.
3. This might be biased but I just really like C. I find visually it is very straightforward and readable and it allows simplicity if you want that and mind-breaking complexity if you want that too. 

<definition title="Keyword">
Any word reserved in a programming language to have a special meaning (for, if, int, etc). Often times, you can't name anything (variables, functions, or types) the same as reserved keywords.
